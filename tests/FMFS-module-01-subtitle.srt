Hello everyone. In today's module we will discuss
about introduction to food microbiology and food safety.

3
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,300
The primary objectives of this module are to
introduce history and progression of

4
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,360
food microbiology and food safety.

5
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,160
To learn the basic concept and scope of
food microbiology and food safety, and to recognize

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,040
the role of food microbiologist and current
status of food microbiology and food safety.

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,120
So in this module, you will learn an important
historical developments in food microbiology and food safety.

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,300
The role of microorganism in food like food
fermentation, food preservation, foodborne

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:05,520
illnesses, food spoilage, food quality control
and emergence of food safety.

10
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,000
And in the last, scope of food microbiology
and food safety.

11
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,200
MUSIC

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,960
Almost every food product has certain kinds
of microorganisms.

13
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,820
Each microorganism has its different role
in food and their presence may influence

14
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,920
the quality and texture of the food.
Some of them have desirable roles

15
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,760
like natural fermentation of the food,
while others causes spoilage and diseases.

16
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,580
In ancient time, people used several methods
of food fermentation, spoilage and preservation.

17
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:44,650
The relationship between microorganism and
food was not established before eighteen hundred.

18
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:50,539
Schwann, in eighteen thirty seven discussed about the yeast
which appeared during alcoholic fermentation

19
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:57,819
and eighteen fifty seven to eighteen seventy six, Pasteur stated
that for the chemical conversion that takes place in

20
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:01,789
food and beverages, microorganisms were responsible.

21
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:07,890
These discoveries were considered as an important
milestone in the evolution of food microbiology.

22
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,640
Later on many discoveries were made about
the activity and potential role of microorganisms

23
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,420
in preserving, spoiling and poisoning of food,
spread over globally.

MUSIC

25
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:30,700
Around eight thousand B.C. agriculture and animal husbandry
were adopted by the early civilizations.

26
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:37,120
Between eight thousand to one thousand B.C. different 
traditional methods for preserving foods such as

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:45,370
drying, cooking, baking, smoking, salting, sugaring
with honey, ice, storage in pits, fermentation

28
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:52,640
with grains, fruits, milk, pickling and spicing
were used mainly to diminish spoilage.

29
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,299
A practice for fermentation was commonly used
by many communities for preserving foods

30
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:03,030
and to produce different kinds of popular foods
using fruits, vegetables and milk.

31
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:10,750
Around the sixteen seventies, after ubiquitous acceptance
of existence of bacteria and yeasts by Leeuwenhoek,

32
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,870
some researchers explored the potential role
of such microorganisms with different types

33
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,209
of food in terms of fermentation, spoilage
and illnesses associated with food.

34
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:28,599
During eighteen seventies, Pasteur initiated the 
possible applications and role of microorganisms in

35
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,460
food and also proved their scientific evidence.

36
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,900
Above findings paved the path of
success in the further development of

37
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,260
early food microbiology in the twentieth century.

102
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:44,900
for meat and poultry, fishery product and juice product
first time. Recently, the importance

103
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:51,339
of microorganisms in the food has increased a lot, due to
their important role in food production.

104
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:55,749
They can be either beneficial or harmful. 
In terms of importance,

105
00:09:55,749 --> 00:10:01,389
all the groups of micro organisms are not
equal interest for a food microbiologist because of

106
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:04,509
different nature and their metabolites.

MUSIC

111
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:29,779
Food safety is a matter of great concern for all of us,
as it begins from crop to gut.

112
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:34,440
An individual may or may not be aware of it,
before having a meal.

113
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,230
But there are many other persons belonging
to various fields like farming, research, industry,

114
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:48,100
government or non-government offices who had great
concerns about the food being served to them.

115
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,480
Safety of food cannot be achieved by a single
individual; it is a joint responsibility of

116
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,360
everyone who is involved in it.

117
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,290
It can be farmer, food processor, consumer
or food regulatory authority. Food is considered

118
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:09,700
safe for human being when it is free from all kinds
of hazards which may be responsible for diseases.

MUSIC

120
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,529
In ancient time, people were not aware of
foodborne diseases or food safety.

121
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:22,000
Although it was known to the people that food spoils.

122
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,879
However, they were not aware of the reason
behind the spoilage of food and subsequent

123
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,310
disease from the consumption of spoiled food.

124
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,769
After the late nineteenth century, scientists have
begun to understand about the bacteria and

125
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:37,110
their relationship to disease.

126
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:43,189
That is why, the history of food safety is the
actually the history of various finding, invention,

127
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:49,700
food regulations and standards that all led to
the knowledge of present time.

The developments of last two decades in the
area of food safety are presented in this slide.

MUSIC

131
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,459
The safety of food is affected by four factors
Changing demographics, lifestyle and demand

132
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:18,900
of consumer, food production and economics,
and the emergence of new pathogenic microorganisms.

MUSIC

134
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:29,861
The prime objective of an implementation of
the food safety management system in food

135
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:38,100
establishments is the is to provide a preventive approach
to identify, prevent and reduce food borne hazards,

136
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,029
like physical, chemical and biological
agents which could minimize the risk of food poisoning

137
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:47,079
and to make food safe for eating.

138
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:52,990
A well-designed FSMS with necessary control
measures can help food manufacturing units to

139
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:59,000
comply with food hygiene regulations and
to ensure that food prepared for sale is

140
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,170
hygienic and safe for consumers.

141
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,560
These programs are preventive in nature and
are implemented by experienced

142
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:14,790
professional staff at various stages of food production
to minimize the exposure of food to contaminants.

143
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:20,490
Many food safety and quality management programs
are integrated to produce safe and hygiene

144
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,309
food consistently for human consumption.

145
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:28,700
These programmes include Good Agricultural
Practices, that is called GAP,

146
